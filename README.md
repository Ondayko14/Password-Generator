# Password Generator

## Introduction
This is a password generator that I made in javascript.
When the button is clicked, then the generator will give the user several prompts as to how they would like their password to be made.
If an incorrect value is placed then it will alert the user and the user will have to try again.

### Prerequisites
Browser that can run Javascript

#### Tech
Javascript
CSS
HTML
